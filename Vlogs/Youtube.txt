1. Binary Search Tree Traversal visual hack
Started with the Tree topic today in my Data structures course, Undergraduate industrial engineering students were finding Binary Search Tree traversal using recursion hard to trace especially when the tree was unbalanced. Coincidentally remember a visualization technique one of my colleagues taught me when I was working in the industry to quickly visualize preorder, inorder, and postorder BST traversal. TA made a video (sorry about the shake and out of focus) both I and the course TA don't have steady hands.
